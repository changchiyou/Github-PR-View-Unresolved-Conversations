# Github-PR-View-Unresolved-Conversations

Quickly view all Github PR unresolved-conversations, by pressing a single button generated by script.

Inspired by [No way to easily view all unresolved conversations #7638](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/7638), especially [the short JS snippet](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/7638#discussioncomment-3083505) provided by [AdamEr8](https://github.com/AdamEr8).

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermoneky](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) on your browser
2. Copy the script [view_unresolved_conversations.js](/scripts/view_unresolved_conversations.js)
   https://github.com/changchiyou/Github-PR-View-Unresolved-Conversations/blob/e060d806035140dc8ccc6c2d1c7e245d936d9f9f/scripts/view_unresolved_conversations.js#L1-L112
3. Paste into Tampermonkey's editor, which can be opened by clicking the tampermonkey icon and select `Create a new script...` option.

> I suggest using this script in conjunction with [Scroll To Top](https://github.com/pratikabu/scrolltotop), as it will greatly enhance the user experience.

## Usage

By clicking the hyperlink on the PR listing page or directly accessing the URL of a specific PR, the `Unresolved Conversations` button will be automatically generated.

You can test the feature with following PRs in this repo:
