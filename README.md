Inspired by [No way to easily view all unresolved conversations #7638](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/7638), especially [the short JS snippet](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/7638#discussioncomment-3083505) provided by [AdamEr8](https://github.com/AdamEr8).

> Despite GitHub's introduction of built-in features in June 2022 to help users quickly find unresolved conversations ([New tools to discover and resolve pull request conversations now generally available](https://github.blog/changelog/2021-06-16-new-tools-to-discover-and-resolve-pull-request-conversations-now-generally-available/)), clicking on the listed unresolved conversations redirects the entire page to a new one, which is time-consuming and affects the user experience. Therefore, I believe this project still holds value.

## Installation

1. Install [Tampermoneky](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) on your browser
2. Access https://raw.githubusercontent.com/changchiyou/Github-PR-View-Unresolved-Conversations/main/scripts/view_unresolved_conversations.user.js with the browser which has already installed [Tampermoneky](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) and click `Install`(`Reinstall` for updating) button.

> ~~I suggest using this script in conjunction with [Scroll To Top](https://github.com/pratikabu/scrolltotop), as it will greatly enhance the user experience.~~ Go-to-tup feature has already been added at [feat: add Go to TOP button next to Resolve conversation button](https://github.com/changchiyou/Github-PR-View-Unresolved-Conversations/commit/7b38b9fa7155da7a3fec531361d526fff882ee19).

## Usage

After accessing any PRs, the `Unresolved Conversations` button will be automatically generated.

You can test the feature with following demo PRs in this repo:
